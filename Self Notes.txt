Key Terms and Symbols in Descriptive Statistics
They are the following:
Descriptive statistics: The branch of statistics that involves organizing, summarizing,
 and displaying data.
Population: The set of all elements of interest in a particular study.
Sample: A subset of the population.

"Measures of central tendency" refer to statistics that describe the typical or middle value of a dataset, 
like the mean, median, and mode, while "Measures of Dispersion" 
describe how spread out the data is, including the range, variance, 
and standard deviation; essentially, central tendency tells you where 
the data is centered, while dispersion tells you how widely the data is distributed around 
that center point.

Measures of Central Tendency
Mean (Average):

The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the mean is (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6.

Median:

The middle value when the data is ordered from least to greatest. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the median is 6. For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8], the median is (4 + 6) / 2 = 5.

Mode:

The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 4, 6, 8], the mode is 4 because it appears most frequently.

Measures of Dispersion(How spread your data is wrt to mean):

Range:

The difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the range is 10 - 2 = 8.

Variance:

The average of the squared differences from the mean.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the mean is 6. 
The squared differences from the mean are (2-6)², (4-6)², (6-6)², (8-6)², (10-6)² 
which are 16, 4, 0, 4, 16. The variance is (16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8.

Standard Deviation:

The square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance from the mean.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the variance is 8. The standard deviation is √8 ≈ 2.83.

Percentile
Definition: A percentile is a measure used in statistics to indicate the value below which a given percentage of observations in a dataset fall. For example, the 25th percentile is the value below which 25% of the observations may be found.
Example: If you have a dataset of exam scores for 100 students, and a student's score is at the 90th percentile, it means that the student scored better than 90% of the other students.
Quartile
Definition: Quartiles are values that divide a dataset into four equal parts, each containing 25% of the data. There are three quartiles:
First Quartile (Q1): Also known as the 25th percentile, it is the value below which 25% of the data fall.
Second Quartile (Q2): Also known as the median or the 50th percentile, it is the value below which 50% of the data fall.
Third Quartile (Q3): Also known as the 75th percentile, it is the value below which 75% of the data fall.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16], the quartiles are:
Q1 (25th percentile) = 5
Q2 (50th percentile or median) = 9
Q3 (75th percentile) = 13
These measures help to understand the distribution of data by dividing it into parts and identifying the spread and central tendency of the dataset.



Definitions:

Quartiles
Quartiles are values that divide a dataset into four equal parts, each containing 25% of the data. There are three quartiles:

First Quartile (Q1):

Also known as the 25th percentile, it is the value below which 25% of the data fall.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16], Q1 is 5. This means that 25% of the data values are less than or equal to 5.
Second Quartile (Q2):

Also known as the median or the 50th percentile, it is the value below which 50% of the data fall.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16], Q2 is 9. This means that 50% of the data values are less than or equal to 9.
Third Quartile (Q3):

Also known as the 75th percentile, it is the value below which 75% of the data fall.
Example: For the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16], Q3 is 13. This means that 75% of the data values are less than or equal to 13.
These quartiles help to understand the distribution of data by dividing it into parts and identifying the spread and central tendency of the dataset.
Interquartile Range (IQR):

The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).
Formula: IQR = Q3 - Q1
Lower Fence:

The lower fence is a threshold used to identify potential outliers below the lower end of the dataset.
Formula: Lower Fence = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
Upper Fence:

The upper fence is a threshold used to identify potential outliers above the upper end of the dataset.
Formula: Upper Fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
Sample Calculation for Outlier Removal
Let's use the dataset [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16] as an example.

Calculate Quartiles:

Q1 (First Quartile) = 5
Q2 (Median or Second Quartile) = 9
Q3 (Third Quartile) = 13
Calculate IQR:

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 13 - 5 = 8
Calculate Lower Fence:

Lower Fence = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 5 - 1.5 * 8 = 5 - 12 = -7
Calculate Upper Fence:

Upper Fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 13 + 1.5 * 8 = 13 + 12 = 25
Identify Outliers:

Any data point below the lower fence (-7) or above the upper fence (25) is considered an outlier.
In this dataset, there are no outliers because all values fall within the range [-7, 25].
Outlier Removal
To remove outliers from a dataset, you can simply exclude any values that fall outside the lower and upper fences.

Example: If the dataset were [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 30], the value 30 would be considered an outlier because it is greater than the upper fence (25). You would remove 30 from the dataset to exclude the outlier.

By using the IQR and fences, you can effectively identify and remove outliers to ensure a more accurate analysis of your data.

Z-Score
Definition: A Z-score (also known as a standard score) indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset. It is a way to standardize scores on a common scale without units.
Interpretation
A Z-score of 0.71 means that the value 8 is 0.71 standard deviations above the mean of the dataset. Z-scores can be used to compare values from different datasets or to identify outliers (typically, values with Z-scores less than -3 or greater than 3 are considered outliers).

Standard Normal Distribution
Definition: The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where the total area under the curve is equal to 1.

Standardization: Standardization (or Z-score normalization) is the process of converting individual data points to a common scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done using the Z-score formula

Purpose of Standardization
Comparison:

Standardization allows for the comparison of scores from different datasets or distributions by converting them to a common scale.
Outlier Detection:

Z-scores can help identify outliers. Typically, values with Z-scores less than -3 or greater than 3 are considered outliers.
Normalization:

Standardization is often used in machine learning and statistical analysis to normalize data, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.
